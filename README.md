# Project Title
Evaluation of Eth-Proof course by Metacrafters


## Description
The evaluation is of Eth-Proof course offered by Metacrafters, a multi-chain learn and earn platform. Throughout this course, we have studied various blockchain concepts and began our exploration of the blockchain industry by establishing a base in solidity.

## Getting Started
### Installing
      * Access remix.ethereum.org,
      * Access the website remix.ethereum.org, which is an internet-based code editor specifically for writing solidity code for Ethereum.
      * Duplicate the code.
      * Now that the setup is finished, you can proceed.

### Features
      * Details of the token: The contract holds the token's name, symbol, and total supply.
      * Balance Management: Users have the ability to check the balance of any given address.
      * Minting involves creating new tokens and adding them to a designated address in order to increase the token supply.
      * Burning tokens: Reduce the total supply by burning tokens from a designated address.
      * Event Transfer: Emits a transfer event each time tokens are created or destroyed.
      
### Executing Program
      * Use the solidity compiler provided on the sidebar or press CTRL + S to compile the program.
      * If you see a green check mark in the sidebar, it indicates that your program ran without any errors.
      * Implement or launch the program
      * Execute all the functions/methods within the contract by running them.
      
### Deployment
      To deploy the MyToken contract: -
      * Open your development environment (e.g., Remix).
      * Copy the MyToken contract code into a new file named MyToken.sol.
      * Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler version 0.8.18.
      * Deploy the contract, specifying the initial token name, symbol, and supply in the constructor.
  
Example constructor parameters:
name: "MyToken"
symbol: "MTK"
initialSupply: 1000
## Help
      * CTRL + S can be utilized for compiling.

### Usage
    After deploying the contract, interact with it as follows:
    Mint Tokens: Incr
